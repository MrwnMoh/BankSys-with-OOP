## 📝 Introduction
A high-performance **Console-based Bank Management System** built with **C++**. This project focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, providing a secure and visually intuitive way to manage banking operations, currency exchange, and user activities.

---

## 🚀 Main Features

### 🔐 1. Authentication & Access
- **Secure Login System:** The gateway to the system with credential verification.
- **Dynamic Permissions:** Each user has specific access rights (Admin/User).
- **Colored Status Indicators:** Visual markers (icons) that change color based on permissions before you even click.

### 👥 2. Client & User Management
- **Client Operations:** Full CRUD (Add, Delete, Update, Find) with encrypted storage.
- **User Operations:** Complete management of system users and their security levels.
- **Permissions Display:** A dedicated screen to view what each user is allowed to do.

### 💰 3. Banking & Transactions
- **Balance Management:** Deposit, Withdraw, and Total Balances.
- **Transfer System:** Secure money transfer between accounts with real-time validation.
- **Transaction Logs:** Automatically recording every financial movement.

### 🌍 4. Currency Exchange System
- **Live-Style Rates:** View currency rates relative to the USD.
- **Currency Finder:** Search for any currency by code or country.
- **Currency Calculator:** Perform instant conversions between different global currencies.

### 🛡️ 5. Security & Logs (Audit Trail)
- **User Move Tracking:** The system records every single click and action by the user.
- **Logs Viewer:** A clean, formatted table for admins to review all system activities.
- **Security Refresh:** A tool to re-encrypt data files for maximum protection.

---

## 🎨 User Interface (UI)
- **Full Color Support:** A professional color-coded terminal experience.
- **Modular Menus:** Intuitive navigation through nested, organized menus.
- **Formatted Tables:** All data is displayed in neat, structured, and colored tables.

---

## 🔐 Encryption Engine (5-Layers)
The system protects sensitive data using a custom-built cryptographic logic:
1. **XOR Cipher** (Primary encryption)
2. **Random Padding** (Noise injection)
3. **Case Inversion** (Casing flip)
4. **Nested XOR** (Second security pass)
5. **Hexadecimal** (Final secure format)
